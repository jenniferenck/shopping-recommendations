## This is a multi-integrated API application. Below are the objectives of this project:

**Users should be able to:**

1. Gain access to their Pinterest Boards via OAuth
2. Search for shopping recommendations based on keywords, selected categories or a board
3. Select a board to give their search `inspiration`
4. See search recommendations that are relevant to their interests

**Notes/ To-dos**

1. Finish populating `theme` pictures of users boards
2. Create a drop-down form for users to create a new search
3. Add stock themes for users to search
4. Finish integrating the Clarifai API, so we can generate keywords based on boards
5. Make our first Clarifai request and get keywords to search on Google Shop API
6. Integrate Google Shop API

## Project

We would like you to build a web app that displays the trending GIFs on [Giphy](https://giphy.com/).
Users visiting the website should be able to search for GIFs and see a list of results. The user should be able to expand a GIF and see its details (username, rating, anything you think could be relevant).

Users should have a good user experience on desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

This project is pretty open ended in order to leave you some freedom to improve upon the base by focusing on what you like the most.

We strongly encourage you to pick a couple of optional improvements. The following are just some ideas, so if none of these interest you, feel free to do something that isn’t on this list:

- When the user scrolls the page to the bottom, load new GIFs automatically.
- Create a mosaic layout and display a placeholder when GIFs are still loading.
- Show off your animation skills!
- Sort the results by uploaded time and let the user choose if they prefer ascending or descending ordering.
- Let the user favorite GIFs and list their favorites. The users should be able to retrieve their favorite GIFs even after refreshing the page.
- Provide the ultimate user experience: scrolling, searching, fetching… could be optimized for UX.
- Let the user upload a GIF.
- Add some unit tests.

### Project Structure

We've included all of the boilerplate to get started with this project using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), feel free to use this structure if you'd like. If you'd prefer to use something other than React or you'd prefer a different project structure, go ahead and make any changes you'd like.

### Evaluation

The app should run on any computer by running `npm install` and `npm start`.
We’ll evaluate the exercise by looking at the end result and the code.

### Notes

Please, don't open a PR against this repo. Just follow the direction from the recruiter on how to submit the exercise.
